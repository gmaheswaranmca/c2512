    "1.You are tasked with designing a simple ""calculator"" program 
        using only a switch-case statement and 
        relational/logical operators. 
        The program should take two integers and a 
        single character operator (+, -, *, /)
        as input. 
        However, it must also handle an error condition 
        where division by zero is attempted, 
        and it should display an appropriate error message in that case. 
        Write the program.
    2.You have a table named Orders with the following structure:
    |OrderID | CustomerID | OrderDate | TotalAmount|
        Write a SQL query to find the CustomerID 
        that has placed exactly 3 orders 
        with a total amount greater 
        than 500 each. 
        Ensure the solution uses aggregate functions and a subquery.
    3.You have a directory named /projects that contains several files and subdirectories. 
        Manually set the following permissions for the directory and all its contents:
        Owner: Read, write, and execute permissions.
        Group: Read and execute permissions.
        Others: Read-only permissions.
        How would you achieve this using Linux commands 
        for a single file and a directory
