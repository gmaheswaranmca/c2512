"Read doctors' salaries (integer) from keyboard till we read -1 
    by using array / collection."
Find average salary (integer), 
prime salaries count(example: Rs.101, prime number salary), 
minimum 4 digit salaries count, 
maximum salary, 
odd salaries sum (example: Rs.5001), and
2nd minimum odd salary.  
Check maximum salary is also prime salary.
Use coding standards and best practices to write pseudo code and c++ code.
Plan the task codes to make as reusable functions.

"Read patients' ages (integer) from keyboard till we read less than zero 
    by using array / collection."
Find average age (integer), 
prime ages sum(example: 11, prime number age), 
teenager ages sum, 
minimum age, 
odd ages sum (example: 51), and
2nd maximum adult age.  
Check minimum age is also prime age.
Use coding standards and best practices to write pseudo code and c++ code.
Plan the task codes to make as reusable functions.


03  [Abel]
"Read patients' temperatures (integer) from keyboard till we read 0
    by using array / collection."
Find average temperature (integer), 
prime temperatures sum(example: 41, prime number temperature), 
minimum 3 digit temperatures sum, 
minimum temperature, 
odd temperatures sum (example: 31), and
2nd maximum odd temperature.  
Check minimum temperature is also prime temperature.
Use coding standards and best practices to write pseudo code and c++ code.
