    PROGRAM:
        •Define a class named student
        •Define a char pointer variable as member variable with any one access specifier
        •Define a constructor with this char pointer variable as parameter 
        •close the class
        •Define a main method
        •initialize a char array with a string value
        •Create an object for the class and pass this array as argument
