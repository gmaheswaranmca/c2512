General Naming Guidelines
    Use Meaningful Names: Names should be descriptive enough to convey the purpose of the object.
    Consistency: Maintain consistent naming conventions across all objects to avoid confusion.
    Avoid Reserved Words: Do not use Oracle reserved keywords as names, as this can lead to errors.
    Case Sensitivity: By default, Oracle names are case-insensitive. However, if you enclose names in double quotes, they become case-sensitive.
Naming Conventions
1. Tables
    Format: PREFIX_OBJECTTYPE_OBJECTNAME
    Examples:
    EMPLOYEES
    CUSTOMERS
    ORDERS

2. Views
    Format: V_OBJECTNAME or VW_OBJECTNAME
    Examples:
    V_EMPLOYEES
    VW_ACTIVE_CUSTOMERS
    V_ORDER_SUMMARY
3. Stored Procedures and Functions
    Format: SP_OBJECTNAME for procedures, FN_OBJECTNAME for functions
    Examples:
    SP_ADD_EMPLOYEE
    FN_GET_TOTAL_SALES
    SP_UPDATE_ORDER_STATUS
4. Synonyms
    Format: SYNONYM_OBJECTNAME
    Examples:
    SYN_EMPLOYEES
    SYN_CUSTOMER_VIEW
5. Triggers
    Format: TRG_OBJECTNAME_EVENT
    Examples:
    TRG_BEFORE_INSERT_EMPLOYEES
    TRG_AFTER_UPDATE_ORDERS
6. Columns
    Format: Use a combination of the table name and the column's purpose.
    Examples:
    For the EMPLOYEES table: EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, HIRE_DATE
    For the ORDERS table: ORDER_ID, ORDER_DATE, CUSTOMER_ID
7. Indexes
Format: IDX_TABLE_COLUMN
Examples:
    IDX_EMPLOYEES_LAST_NAME
    IDX_ORDERS_ORDER_DATE
Additional Best Practices
    Use Underscores: Use underscores to separate words for better readability (e.g., FIRST_NAME instead of FIRSTNAME).
    Limit Length: Keep names concise but descriptive. Oracle has a limit of 30 characters for object names.
    Prefix/Suffix: Use prefixes or suffixes to indicate the type of object (e.g., V_ for views, SP_ for stored procedures).
    Avoid Abbreviations: Avoid using abbreviations that may not be universally understood. If you must use them, document them clearly.
    Example of a Naming Convention in Use
Hereâ€™s a hypothetical example of how these conventions might look in practice:

Table: EMPLOYEES
View: V_EMPLOYEES_ACTIVE
Stored Procedure: SP_ADD_EMPLOYEE
Function: FN_GET_EMPLOYEE_NAME
Trigger: TRG_BEFORE_INSERT_EMPLOYEES
Column: EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME
Index: IDX_EMPLOYEES_LAST_NAME
Summary
Following a consistent naming convention for database objects in Oracle helps improve code readability, maintainability, and collaboration among team members. It's essential to document your chosen conventions so that all team members can adhere to them.
