1. `Introduction to Database`
   - A database is a collection of organized information 
   that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
   - In Oracle, databases are structured 
   to store large amounts of data, 
   allowing users to retrieve and manipulate it efficiently.
   - Oracle Database is a widely used RDBMS known 
   for its scalability, performance, and security.

   Examples: 
      RDBMS: Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, Postgres, SQLite, DB2 etc 
      noSQL: Mongo DB, Cassandra etc 

2. `Introduction to RDBMS`
   - Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) organizes data 
   into tables (relations) and 
   uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation.
   - Oracle is an RDBMS that supports 
   relational data structures and enforces integrity constraints.

3. `Characteristics of Database Management System (DBMS)`
   - `Data Abstraction`: 
   Hides complex data structures, 
   presenting data at different levels 
   (conceptual, logical, physical).
   - `Data Independence`: 
   Ensures changes in data structure do not affect applications.
   - `Efficient Data Access`: 
   Uses indexing, caching, and query optimization 
   to improve performance.
   - `Data Integrity and Security`: 
   Ensures accurate data through 
   integrity constraints and 
   secure access 
   through authorization mechanisms.
   - `Concurrency Control`: 
   Manages simultaneous access 
   using locking mechanisms.
   - `Transaction Management`: 
   Maintains data consistency 
   through atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability 
   (ACID) properties.

4. `Data Modeling`
   - Data modeling is the process of creating 
   a visual representation of the database structure 
   to organize data logically.
   - Oracle supports data models at different levels: 
   conceptual, logical, and physical.
   - Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams are commonly used 
   in data modeling 
   to define entities and relationships.

5. `Relational Data Modeling`
   - Relational data modeling involves designing tables 
   to represent data entities and 
   establishing relationships between them.
   - In Oracle, each entity is represented as a table 
   with columns and rows.
   - Relationships are formed using foreign keys, and 
   data integrity is maintained through primary keys and constraints.

6. `Normalization`
   - Normalization is the process of organizing data 
   to reduce redundancy and improve integrity.
   - The main stages are:
     - `First Normal Form (1NF)`: 
     Eliminates duplicate columns and 
     creates separate tables for related data.
     - `Second Normal Form (2NF)`: 
     Ensures all non-key attributes are 
     fully dependent on the primary key.
     - `Third Normal Form (3NF)`: 
     Ensures that non-key attributes 
     are independent of each other.
   - Oracle recommends normalization 
   to avoid data anomalies and maintain data integrity.

7. `Transaction`
   - A transaction is a set of SQL statements 
   that perform a single logical unit of work, 
   with ACID properties:
     - `Atomicity`: 
     All or nothing principle.
     - `Consistency`: 
     Database remains consistent before and after the transaction.
     - `Isolation`: 
     Each transaction operates independently until completion.
     - `Durability`: 
     Results are permanent even after a system failure.
   - In Oracle, transactions start 
   with a SQL operation and end 
   with a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`.

8. `Types of Keys`
   - `Primary Key`: 
    Unique identifier for table records. 
    Each table should have one primary key.
   - `Foreign Key`: 
    Ensures referential integrity 
    by linking columns in two tables.
   - `Candidate Key`: 
    Columns that can uniquely identify rows 
    but are not chosen as primary keys.
   - `Composite Key`: 
    A primary key formed 
    by combining multiple columns.
   - `Unique Key`: 
    Ensures values in a column or 
    set of columns are unique.
