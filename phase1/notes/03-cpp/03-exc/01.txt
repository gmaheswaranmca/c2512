In C++, exceptions are used 
to handle runtime errors in a structured way, 
separating the error-handling code 
from the normal flow of the program. 

Here's a detailed explanation of exception handling in C++.

`1. Handling Exceptions using `try-catch``

In C++, exceptions are handled using the `try-catch` block. 
The code that may throw an exception is placed 
inside the `try` block, and the `catch` block is used 
to handle the exception when it occurs.

Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    try {
        int x = 10;
        int y = 0;
        if (y == 0) {
            throw "Division by zero error!";  // Throwing an exception
        }
        cout << x / y;
    }
    catch (const char* msg) {
        cout << "Caught an exception: " << msg << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- The code inside the `try` block attempts 
to perform a division by zero.
- If a division by zero occurs, the `throw` statement is executed, 
throwing a string exception.
- The `catch` block catches this exception and prints the error message.

---

`2. Multiple `catch` Blocks`

C++ allows multiple `catch` blocks to handle different types of exceptions. 
This allows you to catch specific exceptions and handle them differently.

Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    try {
        int x = 10;
        int y = 0;
        if (y == 0) {
            throw "Division by zero error!";
        }
        cout << x / y;
    }
    catch (const char* msg) {
        cout << "Caught an exception: " << msg << endl;
    }
    catch (int errorCode) {
        cout << "Caught an integer exception: " << errorCode << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Here, the `catch` block for `const char*` handles string-based exceptions, and 
another `catch` block is available to catch integer-based exceptions. 
However, in this example, only the first `catch` block 
will handle the thrown exception 
because the exception is a string (`const char*`).

---

`3. The `catch` Block to Catch All Exceptions`

In C++, you can use a generic `catch` block to catch any type of exception. 
This is done by specifying an ellipsis (`...`) 
in the `catch` block, which catches all exceptions, regardless of their type.

Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    try {
        int x = 10;
        int y = 0;
        if (y == 0) {
            throw "Division by zero error!";
        }
        cout << x / y;
    }
    catch (...) {
        cout << "Caught an unknown exception!" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `catch (...)` block will catch any 
type of exception thrown, 
whether it's a string, integer, or any other type.

---

`4. Custom Exception`

C++ allows you to create custom exceptions 
by inheriting from the `std::exception` class or 
one of its derived classes. 
Custom exceptions can provide more specific error messages or behavior.

Example of a Custom Exception:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>  // For std::exception
using namespace std;

class InvalidAgeException : public exception {
public:
    const char* what() const noexcept override {
        return "Invalid age exception!";
    }
};

int main() {
    try {
        int age = -5;
        if (age < 0) {
            throw InvalidAgeException();  // Throw custom exception
        }
    }
    catch (const InvalidAgeException& e) {
        cout << "Caught a custom exception: " << e.what() << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- We create a custom exception class `InvalidAgeException` 
that inherits from `std::exception` and 
overrides the `what()` method to provide a custom error message.

- When the `age` is negative, we throw the custom exception, 
which is then caught in the `catch` block.

---

`5. Throwing an Exception`

In C++, exceptions are thrown using the `throw` keyword. 
You can throw any object 
(e.g., primitive types, classes, or custom exceptions).

Example of Throwing an Exception:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void testFunction(int num) {
    if (num < 0) {
        throw "Negative number error!";
    }
    cout << "Number is " << num << endl;
}

int main() {
    try {
        testFunction(-1);  // This will throw an exception
    }
    catch (const char* msg) {
        cout << "Caught exception: " << msg << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Here, the `testFunction` checks if the `num` is negative, and 
if it is, it throws a `const char*` exception. 
This exception is then caught in the `main` function.

---

`Summary of Exception Handling Concepts in C++:`

- ``try-catch``: Used to handle exceptions. 
Code that may throw an exception is enclosed in the `try` block, and 
any exceptions are caught and handled in the `catch` block.
- `Multiple `catch` blocks`: You can have more than one `catch` block 
to handle different types of exceptions separately.
- `Generic `catch` block`: A `catch` block 
that catches all types of exceptions using the `...` syntax.
- `Custom Exceptions`: You can define custom exceptions 
by inheriting from the `std::exception` class (or any derived class)
to handle specific errors in your application.
- `Throwing exceptions`: The `throw` keyword is used 
to explicitly throw an exception when an error condition is met.

This structure allows you to manage errors efficiently and 
in a way that ensures the normal flow of your program is 
not disrupted by unexpected conditions.


=============================================================================

The code you provided defines a custom exception class `InvalidAgeException` 
that inherits from `std::exception`. 
This class overrides the `what()` method 
to provide a custom error message. 
Let's break down the code and explain each part:

Explanation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>  // For std::exception

class InvalidAgeException : public std::exception {
public:
    const char* what() const noexcept override {
        return "Invalid age exception!";  // Custom error message
    }
};
```

1. `Inheriting from `std::exception`:`
   - `InvalidAgeException` inherits from `std::exception`, 
   which is the base class for all standard exceptions in C++. 
   This allows your custom exception 
   to behave like any other standard exception.
   
2. `Overriding `what()` method:`
   - The `what()` method is overridden 
   to provide a custom message when the exception is thrown. 
   The `what()` method returns a `const char*` 
   that holds the error message.

   - The `noexcept` specifier tells the compiler 
   that this method will not throw any exceptions. 
   It's used to ensure 
   that the exception handling code is efficient and safe.

3. `Throwing and Catching the Custom Exception:`

Here's how you can throw and catch this custom exception:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>  // For std::exception

class InvalidAgeException : public std::exception {
public:
    const char* what() const noexcept override {
        return "Invalid age exception!";  // Custom error message
    }
};

int main() {
    try {
        int age = -5;  // Invalid age
        if (age < 0) {
            throw InvalidAgeException();  // Throw the custom exception
        }
        std::cout << "Age is: " << age << std::endl;
    }
    catch (const InvalidAgeException& e) {
        std::cout << "Caught exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;  // Catch and handle custom exception
    }

    return 0;
}
```

`What Happens in the Code:`

1. The `main()` function contains a check for a valid age.
 If the age is invalid (negative), it throws an `InvalidAgeException`.
2. The `catch` block catches this specific exception and 
prints the custom error message provided by the `what()` method.

`Key Points:`

- `Inheritance`: The custom exception class inherits from `std::exception`, 
which makes it compatible with the C++ exception-handling mechanism.
- `Overriding `what()``: The `what()` method is overridden 
to return a custom error message.

- ``noexcept``: The `noexcept` specifier indicates 
that the `what()` method is not supposed to throw exceptions, 
improving exception safety.

This approach is very useful for defining specific errors 
in your program and handling them in a structured way.

=============================================================================

`stdexcept` is a header file in C++ 
that defines a set of standard exception classes used 
for handling common errors in C++ programs. 
It is part of the C++ Standard Library and 
provides predefined exception types that are 
derived from the base class `std::exception`.

Hereâ€™s an overview of some important aspects of `stdexcept` and the exceptions it defines:

`1. The `std::exception` Base Class:`
   - The `std::exception` class is the base class 
   for all standard exceptions in C++. 
   It provides a virtual function `what()` 
   that returns a C-style string describing the exception. 
   This can be overridden by derived classes 
   to provide more specific messages.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <stdexcept>

   int main() {
       try {
           throw std::exception();  // Throwing the base exception class
       } catch (const std::exception& e) {
           std::cout << "Caught exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```

`2. Common Exception Classes in `stdexcept`:`

`stdexcept` provides several specific exception classes 
that derive from `std::exception` 
to represent different types of errors:

`a. `std::logic_error`:`
   - This is the base class for exceptions that are caused by logical errors in the program. 
   These errors occur when the program's logic is flawed 
   (e.g., invalid arguments, out-of-range access).
   - Derived classes include:
     - ``std::invalid_argument``: Thrown when an invalid argument is passed to a function.
     - ``std::domain_error``: Thrown when an argument is outside of a valid domain.
     - ``std::length_error``: Thrown when an operation results in exceeding the allowed length 
     (e.g., adding too many elements to a container).
     - ``std::out_of_range``: Thrown when an index or subscript is out of range.

Example of `std::invalid_argument`:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>  // For std::invalid_argument

void checkAge(int age) {
    if (age < 0) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Age cannot be negative.");
    }
}

int main() {
    try {
        checkAge(-5);  // Invalid age, will throw an exception
    } catch (const std::invalid_argument& e) {
        std::cout << "Caught exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

`b. `std::runtime_error`:`
   - This is the base class for exceptions that are caused by runtime errors, 
   often indicating that an error occurred 
   while the program was running (e.g., file not found, memory allocation failure).
   - Derived classes include:
     - ``std::overflow_error``: Thrown when a mathematical overflow occurs 
     (e.g., adding two large numbers).
     - ``std::underflow_error``: Thrown when a mathematical underflow occurs 
     (e.g., subtracting too small a number from a large one).
     - ``std::range_error``: 
     Thrown when a value is out of the range of valid inputs.
     - ``std::ios_base::failure``: Thrown for I/O errors.

Example of `std::overflow_error`:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>  // For std::overflow_error

void checkOverflow(int num) {
    if (num > 1000) {
        throw std::overflow_error("Number is too large and causes overflow.");
    }
}

int main() {
    try {
        checkOverflow(5000);  // Will throw overflow exception
    } catch (const std::overflow_error& e) {
        std::cout << "Caught exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

`3. `std::bad_alloc`:`
   - This is a specific exception class 
   that is thrown when dynamic memory allocation fails 
   (e.g., when `new` cannot allocate memory).

Example of `std::bad_alloc`:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <new>  // For std::bad_alloc

int main() {
    try {
        int* arr = new int[100000000000];  // Attempt to allocate too much memory
    } catch (const std::bad_alloc& e) {
        std::cout << "Caught exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

`4. `std::exception` Methods:`
   - ``what()``: This is the virtual function of `std::exception` 
   that returns a string describing the exception. 
   It is used to retrieve the error message associated with the exception.
   
   Example:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <stdexcept>

   int main() {
       try {
           throw std::runtime_error("An error occurred during runtime");
       } catch (const std::exception& e) {
           std::cout << "Caught exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   In this example, `e.what()` will return the error message `"An error occurred during runtime"`.

`Summary of `stdexcept` Exceptions:`

- ``std::exception``: The base class for all standard exceptions.
- ``std::logic_error``: Used for exceptions related to errors 
in the programâ€™s logic (e.g., invalid argument, out-of-range access).
- ``std::runtime_error``: Used for runtime errors 
that occur during program execution (e.g., overflow, I/O failure).
- ``std::bad_alloc``: Thrown when dynamic memory allocation fails.
- ``what()` method`: A member function of `std::exception` and 
its derived classes, which returns a description of the error.

`stdexcept` provides a range of predefined exception classes that make it easier 
to handle various common error conditions 
in a C++ program, thus improving robustness and readability.
