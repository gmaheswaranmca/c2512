When you use ``std::sort`` with the ``std::execution::par`` policy, 
the `parallel execution policy` allows the sorting operation 
to split the work among multiple threads. 
Here's a detailed explanation of 
how the `parallel algorithm for sorting` works under the hood:

---

`Step-by-Step Process`

1. `Input and Problem Breakdown`
   - The input vector is `vec = {5, 3, 8, 1, 2}`.
   - Sorting involves rearranging the elements in ascending order: `{1, 2, 3, 5, 8}`.
   - In parallel sorting, the algorithm breaks the task into 
   smaller subproblems to sort parts of the vector simultaneously 
   across multiple threads.

---

2. `Splitting the Work`
   - The parallel execution policy (`std::execution::par`) 
   divides the input range (`vec.begin()` to `vec.end()`) into chunks.
   - Each chunk is assigned to a separate thread 
   for independent processing.
   - For instance, the vector might be divided as follows:
     - Thread 1: `{5, 3}`
     - Thread 2: `{8, 1, 2}`
   - The chunk size and division depend on:
     - The total number of elements in the range.
     - The number of available hardware threads.

---

3. `Sorting Chunks Independently`
   - Each thread sorts its assigned chunk independently 
   using a standard sequential sorting algorithm 
   (like `QuickSort` or `MergeSort`).
   - Example:
     - Thread 1 sorts `{5, 3}` into `{3, 5}`.
     - Thread 2 sorts `{8, 1, 2}` into `{1, 2, 8}`.

---

4. `Merging the Results`
   - After the threads complete sorting their chunks, 
   the results are merged.
   - The merging process combines the sorted chunks 
   into a single sorted range:
     - `{3, 5}` and `{1, 2, 8}` are merged into `{1, 2, 3, 5, 8}`.
   - The merging step is often implemented 
   using a `parallel merge` algorithm to further optimize performance.

---

5. `Synchronization`
   - During and after the merge, the threads synchronize their results.
   - The algorithm ensures no data races occur, 
   maintaining the integrity of the final sorted sequence.

---

6. `Result Delivery`
   - Once all threads complete their work and the merging is done, 
   the sorted vector `{1, 2, 3, 5, 8}` is returned to the main thread.

---

`Advantages of Parallel Sorting`

- `Speedup for Large Data`
  - Parallel sorting excels when sorting large datasets 
  because the workload is distributed, 
  reducing the time to complete the operation.
  - Each thread works on a smaller portion, leading to faster overall execution.

- `Scalability`
  - The algorithm scales well 
  with the number of available cores/threads on the hardware.

`Key Components in Parallel Sorting`

1. `Task Partitioning`
   - The input is divided into smaller ranges, 
   with each range assigned to a thread.
   
2. `Thread Management`
   - The `C++ Standard Library` handles thread creation and management.
   - It uses a thread pool internally 
   to minimize the overhead of creating and destroying threads.

3. `Load Balancing`
   - The library ensures efficient load balancing so that 
   no thread is significantly underutilized or overburdened.

4. `Parallel Merge`
   - A merging algorithm combines the sorted results 
   from individual threads efficiently.

---

`Hardware-Level Optimizations`

- `Multithreading`
  - Parallel sorting leverages multi-core CPUs 
  to execute threads simultaneously.
  
- `Cache Optimization`
  - Sorting smaller chunks ensures better cache utilization, 
  as smaller chunks fit in the CPU's cache.
  
- `Vectorization (`par_unseq`)`
  - If you use ``std::execution::par_unseq``, 
  the algorithm might leverage SIMD 
  (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions 
  for further acceleration.

`When to Use Parallel Sorting`

- `Large Data Sets`
  - Sorting small datasets in parallel is inefficient 
  due to thread management overhead.
  
- `Multicore Systems`
  - Parallel sorting is effective on hardware 
  with multiple cores or processors.

`Example Walkthrough`

For the given example:

`Vector`: `{5, 3, 8, 1, 2}`

1. `Split into Chunks`:
   - Assume the vector is divided into 
   `{5, 3}` (Thread 1) and `{8, 1, 2}` (Thread 2).

2. `Sort Independently`:
   - Thread 1 sorts `{5, 3}` → `{3, 5}`.
   - Thread 2 sorts `{8, 1, 2}` → `{1, 2, 8}`.

3. `Merge Chunks`:
   - `{3, 5}` and `{1, 2, 8}` are merged:
     - Compare smallest elements:
       - `1` is smaller than `3`.
     - Continue until all elements are merged → `{1, 2, 3, 5, 8}`.

4. `Output`:
   - The final sorted vector is printed: `1 2 3 5 8`.

---

`Caveats`

1. `Overhead`
   - For small datasets, the overhead of managing threads 
   can outweigh the performance gains.
   
2. `Determinism`
   - While the output is always sorted, 
   the execution order of operations within threads is not deterministic.

3. `Hardware Dependency`
   - Performance benefits depend on the number of CPU cores and 
   the nature of the workload.
