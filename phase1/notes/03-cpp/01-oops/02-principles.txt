`Abstraction` and `Encapsulation` are 
two fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, 
but they serve different purposes:

---

`Abstraction`
`Definition:`  
Abstraction focuses on `hiding the implementation details` and 
showing only the necessary features of an object. 
It allows you to work with an object 
at a higher level of detail 
without worrying about how it performs its tasks.

`Key Points:`
- Concerned with `what an object does`, not `how it does it`.
- Achieved using `abstract classes` or `interfaces`.

Example:
Imagine a `Car`. As a user, you interact 
with its features like 
starting the engine, driving, and braking. 
You don’t need to understand 
the internal working of the engine or braking system.

```csharp
// Abstract Class
public abstract class Vehicle
{
    public abstract void Start();
    public abstract void Stop();
}

// Derived Class
public class Car : Vehicle
{
    public override void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car engine started.");
    }
    public override void Stop()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car stopped.");
    }
}

// Usage
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Vehicle myCar = new Car();
        myCar.Start(); // Output: Car engine started.
        myCar.Stop();  // Output: Car stopped.
    }
}
```

Here, the `Vehicle` class abstracts the concept of a vehicle, 
hiding the specific implementation of starting or stopping the vehicle.

---

`Encapsulation`
`Definition:`  
Encapsulation is the process of `binding data and methods` 
that operate on the data into a single unit (class) and 
`restricting direct access` to some of the object’s components. 
It helps to `protect data` from unauthorized access and modification.

`Key Points:`
- Concerned with `how data is protected and manipulated`.
- Achieved using `access modifiers` like `private`, `protected`, and `public`.

Example:
Imagine a `Bank Account`. Users can deposit or withdraw money, 
but they cannot directly access or modify the balance. 
This ensures that all changes to the balance are controlled and validated.

```csharp
public class BankAccount
{
    private decimal balance; // Encapsulated field

    public decimal Balance // Public property
    {
        get { return balance; }
        private set { balance = value; } // Only internal changes allowed
    }

    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0)
        {
            Balance += amount;
            Console.WriteLine($"Deposited: {amount}");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Invalid deposit amount.");
        }
    }

    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= Balance)
        {
            Balance -= amount;
            Console.WriteLine($"Withdrawn: {amount}");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Invalid withdraw amount.");
        }
    }
}

// Usage
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
        account.Deposit(1000);  // Deposited: 1000
        account.Withdraw(500); // Withdrawn: 500
        Console.WriteLine(account.Balance); // Output: 500
    }
}
```

Here, the `balance` field is private and 
only accessible via public methods 
(`Deposit` and `Withdraw`). 
This prevents direct manipulation of 
the balance and ensures proper validation.

`Summary`
| Concept        | Abstraction                                     | Encapsulation                                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `Focus`      | Hiding implementation details                  | Protecting data and methods                    |
| `Achieved by`| Abstract classes, interfaces                  | Access modifiers, private fields, properties   |
| `Example`    | Vehicle abstraction (Car inherits Vehicle)     | BankAccount class encapsulates balance field   |

Both abstraction and encapsulation work together 
to create robust and maintainable OOP designs.
