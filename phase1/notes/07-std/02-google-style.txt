Google's C++ Style Guide provides a comprehensive set of rules and best practices for writing clear, maintainable, and efficient C++ code. Here are the key points the guide emphasizes:

---

`1. General Coding Principles`
- `Consistency`: Maintain consistency within a file, a project, or a team to improve readability.
- `Clarity`: Code should be easy to understand; avoid overly clever solutions.
- `Efficiency`: Prioritize efficient solutions, but not at the cost of code clarity or maintainability.
- `Safety`: Write code that avoids undefined behavior and ensures safety in memory management.

---

`2. File Organization`
- `Header Files (`.h`)`:
  - Use include guards or `#pragma once` to avoid multiple inclusions.
  - Keep headers minimal by forward-declaring types when possible.
  - Avoid including implementation details.
- `Implementation Files (`.cc`)`:
  - Include headers in the `.cc` file.
  - Place `#include` statements in the order: own header, system headers, library headers.

---

`3. Naming Conventions`
- `Classes and Types`: Use `PascalCase` (e.g., `EmployeeRecord`).
- `Functions`: Use `PascalCase` (e.g., `OpenFile`).
- `Variables`: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `employee_count`), with trailing underscores for non-static member variables (`name_`).
- `Constants`: Use `kPascalCase` (e.g., `kMaxBufferSize`).
- `Namespaces`: Use `lowercase_with_underscores` (e.g., `my_project`).
- `Macros`: Use `ALL_CAPS` with underscores (e.g., `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`).

---

`4. Classes`
- Prefer `composition` over inheritance unless inheritance is semantically correct.
- Avoid public data members; use private members with accessor methods.
- Use initializer lists in constructors when possible.
- Declare destructors as `virtual` in base classes if the class is intended for polymorphism.
- Mark classes as `final` if they are not intended to be derived from.

---

`5. Functions`
- Write short, well-focused functions.
- Pass objects by reference when appropriate (use `const&` for read-only parameters).
- Prefer `override` for overridden virtual functions.
- Use `constexpr` when possible for constant expressions.

---

`6. Variables`
- Minimize variable scope and initialize variables as close to their usage as possible.
- Prefer `auto` for readability when the type is obvious.
- Use `constexpr` and `const` instead of macros for constant values.

---

`7. Memory Management`
- Prefer smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`) over raw pointers.
- Avoid manual memory management (`new` and `delete`).
- Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) for managing resources.

---

`8. Error Handling`
- Use exceptions sparingly, and only when recovering from errors is possible.
- Prefer error codes or `std::optional` for handling recoverable errors.
- Use assertions (`assert()`) to catch programming errors during development.

---

`9. Style and Formatting`
- Use 2 spaces for indentation (Google's default).
- Limit line length to 80 characters when possible.
- Use spaces around operators (`x = y + z;`) and after commas in function calls.

---

`10. Standard Library`
- Prefer using the C++ Standard Library (STL) over custom solutions:
  - Use `std::vector` instead of raw arrays.
  - Use `std::string` instead of `char*`.
  - Use algorithms like `std::sort` instead of writing custom sorting logic.

---

`11. Templates`
- Use templates for generic programming but avoid overuse.
- Keep template definitions simple and prefer type traits for specialization.

---

`12. Multithreading and Concurrency`
- Prefer thread-safe abstractions (e.g., `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, `std::atomic`).
- Avoid low-level thread manipulation unless necessary.
- Use thread pools or task-based concurrency where appropriate.

---

`13. Testing`
- Write unit tests for all code.
- Use Google Test (`gtest`) or similar frameworks for testing.
- Ensure tests cover edge cases and invalid inputs.

---

`14. Tooling`
- Use modern C++ tools like `clang-tidy`, `cppcheck`, and `valgrind` to catch issues early.
- Adhere to modern C++ standards (C++11 and later).
- Use a consistent build system (e.g., Bazel, CMake).

---

`15. Performance`
- Measure performance before optimizing.
- Avoid premature optimization; focus on readability and maintainability first.
- Use profilers to identify bottlenecks.

---

`16. Deprecated Features`
- Avoid using old C-style code (e.g., `malloc/free`, `printf`, raw arrays).
- Prefer modern C++ features like smart pointers, STL containers, and lambdas.

---

`17. Code Reviews`
- All code changes must go through peer review.
- Reviews should focus on correctness, readability, and adherence to style guidelines.

---

`18. Best Practices`
- Avoid global variables; use constants or static members instead.
- Make functions and classes as specific as possible to their task.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Write self-documenting code; avoid unnecessary comments.
