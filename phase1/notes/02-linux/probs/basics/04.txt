Beginner Level Problem Statement: 
Using the `vi` Editor for C++ Program Development

`Objective`:  
Learn to use the `vi` editor effectively 
to create, edit, and manage C++ programs 
in a Linux environment.

---

`Tasks`:

1. `Create a new C++ project directory`:
   - Create a directory called `vi_cpp_project` 
   to store your C++ programs.
   
2. `Navigate to the project directory`:
   - Change into the `vi_cpp_project` directory.

3. `Create a new C++ file using `vi` editor`:
   - Open `vi` and create a new file called `welcome.cpp`.

4. `Write a basic C++ program in `vi``:
   - In `vi`, write a simple C++ program 
   that prints "Welcome to Linux programming!".
   
5. `Save and exit the `vi` editor`:
   - After writing the code, save the file and exit `vi`.

6. `Edit the program`:
   - Open `welcome.cpp` again in `vi`, and 
   modify the program to ask for the user's name and 
   greet them by name.
   - Use `vi` commands to navigate and modify the file, 
   such as inserting text, deleting lines, 
   and saving changes.

7. `Compile the C++ program`:
   - Compile the program using the `g++` compiler 
   into an executable called `welcome`.

8. `Run the compiled program`:
   - Run the executable to check if the program works 
   as expected (asks for name and greets).

9. `View the contents of the C++ file`:
   - Use the `cat` command 
   to display the contents of `welcome.cpp`.

10. `Use `vi` to make further edits`:
    - Open `welcome.cpp` in `vi` and 
    add an additional line to print "Goodbye!" 
    at the end of the program.

11. `Compile and run the updated program`:
    - After editing, recompile and run the program 
    to ensure it displays the welcome message followed 
    by the goodbye message.

12. `Delete the C++ file`:
    - Once finished, remove the `welcome.cpp` file.

13. `Remove the project directory`:
    - Check if the directory is empty and remove it.

`Goal`:  
By completing these tasks, 
you will gain hands-on experience with the `vi` editor 
for creating and editing C++ programs, 
navigating within files, and 
using `vi` commands like `i` (insert), `dd` (delete), 
`:wq` (save and quit), and more.
