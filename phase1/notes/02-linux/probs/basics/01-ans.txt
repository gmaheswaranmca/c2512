Here's a step-by-step guide to solving the 
`Beginner Level Problem Statement` 
for Linux commands in C++ development.

---

1. `Basic File and Directory Management`:

`Create a directory for your C++ project`:
```bash
mkdir project_name
```
This will create a new directory called `project_name`.

`List files in a directory`:
```bash
ls
```
This will list all the files and directories in the current directory.

`Change to the project directory`:
```bash
cd project_name
```
This will move you into the `project_name` directory.

`Create a C++ file`:
```bash
touch hello.cpp
```
This will create a new file named `hello.cpp` in the current directory.

---

2. `Compiling Simple C++ Programs`:

`Write a simple C++ program`:
Create the `hello.cpp` file with a simple program, 
using `nano` or another text editor:

```bash
nano hello.cpp
```
Add this code inside `hello.cpp`:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

`Compile the C++ program`:
```bash
g++ -o hello hello.cpp
```
This compiles `hello.cpp` and creates an executable called `hello`.

`Run the compiled program`:
```bash
./hello
```
The output should be:
```
Hello, World!
```

---

3. `Basic Text Editing`:

`Edit the C++ file`:
You can open and edit `hello.cpp` using `nano` (or any editor):
```bash
nano hello.cpp
```
Make any necessary changes and then save the file 
by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y` to confirm, and `Enter` to save.

---

4. `Using `cat` to View File Content`:

`View the contents of the file`:
```bash
cat hello.cpp
```
This will display the content of `hello.cpp` in the terminal.

---

5. `File Removal`:

`Remove the C++ file`:
```bash
rm hello.cpp
```
This will delete the `hello.cpp` file.

`Remove an empty directory`:
```bash
rmdir project_name
```
This will delete the `project_name` directory if it's empty.

---

6. `Navigating Directories`:

`Go to the home directory`:
```bash
cd ~
```
This will take you to your home directory.

`Go to the parent directory`:
```bash
cd ..
```
This moves you one level up in the directory structure.

`Check the current directory`:
```bash
pwd
```
This will print the full path of the current directory.

---

7. `Viewing System Information`:

`Display the current user`:
```bash
whoami
```
This will display the username of the currently logged-in user.

`Display the current date and time`:
```bash
date
```
This will show the current date and time.

---

8. `Simple Process Management`:

`View running processes`:
```bash
ps
```
This will display the currently running processes.

`End a process`:
First, find the process ID (PID) by running `ps`, then kill it:
```bash
kill <PID>
```
For example:
```bash
kill 1234
```

---

9. `Viewing File Sizes and Disk Space`:

`View file sizes in a directory`:
```bash
ls -lh
```
This shows the file sizes in a human-readable format (KB, MB, GB).

`Check disk usage`:
```bash
df -h
```
This will show the disk space usage in a human-readable format.

---

10. `Redirecting Output`:

`Redirect output to a file`:
```bash
echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt
```
This will write "Hello, World!" to a file named `output.txt`.

`View the content of the file`:
```bash
cat output.txt
```
This will display the contents of `output.txt`.

---

Summary of Commands:

1. `File and Directory Management`: `mkdir`, `ls`, `cd`, `touch`, `rm`, `rmdir`
2. `Compiling`: `g++ -o hello hello.cpp`, `./hello`
3. `Text Editing`: `nano hello.cpp`
4. `Viewing File Content`: `cat hello.cpp`
5. `Process Management`: `ps`, `kill`
6. `System Information`: `whoami`, `date`, `pwd`
7. `Disk Usage`: `df -h`, `ls -lh`
8. `Redirecting Output`: `echo "text" > file.txt`, `cat file.txt`

By completing these steps, 
you will become familiar with the most basic and essential Linux commands, 
which are foundational for C++ development in a Linux environment.
