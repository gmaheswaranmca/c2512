Problem Statement: `Employee Salary Management System`

`Objective`:  
You need to develop a C++ program that performs the following tasks:

1. `Input an Array of Salaries`:
   - The program should take input for the salaries of `10 employees` 
   (you can modify the number as required).
   - The program should store these salaries in an array.

2. `Find the Second Highest Salary`:
   - Implement a function to find the second highest salary in the array.

3. `Check if the Second Highest Salary is Exactly 5 Digits`:
   - After identifying the second highest salary, 
   check whether the salary is a 5-digit number (between 10000 and 99999).
   - Print a message indicating 
   whether the second highest salary is 5 digits or not.

4. `Print All Salaries`:
   - Implement a function 
   to print all employee salaries stored in the array.

`Modular Approach`:
- Break the problem into multiple functions:
  - A function for `inputting the salaries`.
  - A function for `finding the second highest salary`.
  - A function for `checking if the salary is 5 digits`.
  - A function for `printing all salaries`.

Requirements:
- Use `functions` for modular programming.
- The program should be able 
to handle the array of salaries, 
find the second highest salary, 
check if it's a 5-digit salary, and 
print the salaries.
- Use basic `branching statements`, `loops`, and `arrays`.
- Develop the program step-by-step 
in the `vi editor` to learn various commands.

`Steps for Learning and Implementation`:

1. `Create the Program`:
   - Develop the program using the `vi` editor in Linux.
   - Use `Linux commands` to compile and run the program.

2. `Incremental Development`:
   - First, implement the input function.
   - Then, add the function to find the second highest salary.
   - Follow by checking if the second highest salary is 5 digits.
   - Finally, print the salaries.

By following this problem statement, 
you will be able to learn:
- `C++ programming` concepts such as 
arrays, functions, and branching statements.
- How to work with `Linux commands` 
for file handling, compiling, and running C++ programs.
- How to use the `vi editor` 
for editing C++ code.
