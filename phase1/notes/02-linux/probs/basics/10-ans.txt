Here's a step-by-step solution to help you work 
with the problem statement effectively 
using Linux commands and the `vi`/`vim` editor. 
This will cover the use of Linux commands 
like `cat`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `cp`, `ls`, `pwd`, `grep`, 
`rm`, `ln`, `ssh`, `scp`, `ps`, `top`, `free`, and 
more.

1. `Create the `EmployeeData` Directory`

Start by creating a directory to store employee files:

```bash
mkdir EmployeeData
cd EmployeeData
```

Now you have the `EmployeeData` directory, and you're inside it.

---

2. `Create Files for Each Employee`

Create a few files (for example, employee1.txt, employee2.txt) 
using the `touch` command:

```bash
touch employee1.txt employee2.txt employee3.txt
```

You can verify that the files are created using the `ls` command:

```bash
ls
```

---

3. `Edit Employee Files Using `vi`/`vim``

Open one of the employee files with `vi`:

```bash
vi employee1.txt
```

In `vi`, you can:
- Press `i` to enter `insert mode` and start typing.
- Add employee details, such as:

```
Name: John Doe
Salary: 50000
Job Title: Software Engineer
```

Once done, press `Esc` to return to `command mode`.

- To `save and exit`, type `:wq` and press `Enter`.
- To `quit without saving`, type `:q!` and press `Enter`.

---

4. `List the Files in the Directory`

You can list the files in your `EmployeeData` directory:

```bash
ls
```

This will show all the employee files you created.

---

5. `View Employee Files Using `cat``

To view the content of a file, use the `cat` command:

```bash
cat employee1.txt
```

This will print the contents of `employee1.txt` to the terminal.

---

6. `Search for Employee Information Using `grep``

Search for a specific name or job title in all employee files 
using `grep`. For example, to find the name "John":

```bash
grep "John" *.txt
```

This will search for "John" in all `.txt` files and 
print matching lines.

---

7. `Move or Copy Employee Files`

To move `employee1.txt` to a different directory
 (for example, to a backup folder),
use the `mv` command:

```bash
mkdir Backup
mv employee1.txt Backup/
```

To copy `employee2.txt` to another directory:

```bash
cp employee2.txt Backup/
```

---

8. `Remove Employee Files`

To remove a file, use the `rm` command:

```bash
rm employee3.txt
```

To remove an entire directory (if it's empty), 
use the `rmdir` command:

```bash
rmdir Backup
```

---

9. `Create a Symbolic Link`

Create a symbolic link to `employee1.txt`:

```bash
ln -s employee1.txt emp_link.txt
```

Now, `emp_link.txt` is a symbolic link pointing to `employee1.txt`.

---

10. `Monitor System Resources Using `ps`, `top`, and `free``

- Use `ps` to view the current processes running on your system:

  ```bash
  ps aux
  ```

- Use `top` to see an interactive display of 
system processes, CPU usage, and memory usage:

  ```bash
  top
  ```

- Use `free` to check memory usage:

  ```bash
  free -h
  ```

---

11. `Connect to a Remote Server Using `ssh``

To connect to a remote server, use the `ssh` command. 
Replace `username` and `hostname` 
with your actual username and the server's address:

```bash
ssh username@hostname
```

---

12. `Copy a File to Remote Server Using `scp``

To copy a file from your local system to the remote server:

```bash
scp employee1.txt username@hostname:/remote/directory
```

This will copy `employee1.txt` 
to the specified directory on the remote server.

---

13. `Edit the `vim` Configuration File`

To configure the `vim` editor, edit the `~/.vimrc` file:

```bash
vi ~/.vimrc
```

You can add configurations 
to make your `vim` editor more efficient, 
for example:

```
set number           " Display line numbers
set hlsearch         " Highlight search results
set ignorecase       " Ignore case while searching
```

Once you've added your desired settings, 
save and exit by typing `:wq`.

---

Conclusion

By following these steps, 
you will have used a variety of Linux commands and 
the `vi`/`vim` editor 
to manage files, directories, and processes. 

You will also have configured the `vim` editor 
to suit your development needs.
