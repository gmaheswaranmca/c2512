Beginner Level Problem Statement: 
Mastering `vi` Editor for C++ File Management

`Objective`:  
Learn how to effectively use the `vi` editor 
to create, edit, and manage a basic C++ program, 
focusing on the use of `vi` commands 
for efficient file editing and navigation.

---

`Tasks`:

1. `Create a C++ project directory`:
   - Create a directory named `vi_cpp_exercise` to store your C++ program files.
   
2. `Navigate to the `vi_cpp_exercise` directory`:
   - Use the `cd` command to move into the `vi_cpp_exercise` directory.

3. `Create a C++ program file using `vi``:
   - Open the `vi` editor and create a file called `simple_calc.cpp`.

4. `Write a basic C++ program`:
   - In the `vi` editor, write a program that adds two numbers and displays the result.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>
     using namespace std;

     int main() {
         int a, b;
         cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
         cin >> a >> b;
         cout << "The sum is: " << a + b << endl;
         return 0;
     }
     ```

5. `Save and exit the file`:
   - Save the file and exit `vi` using `:wq`.

6. `Reopen the file and modify the program`:
   - Reopen `simple_calc.cpp` using `vi` and 
   modify the program to also 
   subtract, multiply, and divide the two numbers.

7. `Use `vi` to navigate and edit the file`:
   - Use commands like `i` (insert), `x` (delete character), 
   `dd` (delete line), and `u` (undo) to modify the code.
   - Add additional code to handle division and 
   print an error message for division by zero.

8. `Compile the program`:
   - Compile the updated program using `g++` and 
   create an executable called `simple_calc`.

9. `Run the compiled program`:
   - Run the executable to test the program and verify 
   that it correctly adds, subtracts, multiplies, and 
   divides two numbers.

10. `View the contents of the C++ file`:
    - Use the `cat` command 
    to view the contents of `simple_calc.cpp`.

11. `Remove the `simple_calc.cpp` file`:
    - After testing the program, 
    delete the C++ file using the `rm` command.

12. `Remove the project directory`:
    - Check if the `vi_cpp_exercise` directory is empty and 
    then remove it.

`Goal`:  
By completing this task, you will gain proficiency 
in using the `vi` editor for creating and modifying C++ programs, 
navigating through files, editing content, and 
saving changes effectively. 
You will also become comfortable compiling and 
running C++ programs on Linux using basic terminal commands.
