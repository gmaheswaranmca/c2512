Beginner Level Problem Statement: 
Using `vi` Editor for Simple C++ Program and File Management

`Objective`:  
Learn how to use the `vi` editor 
to create, edit, and manage a basic C++ program. 
This task will also help you practice basic Linux commands 
for file management and program compilation.

---

`Tasks`:

1. `Create a C++ project directory`:
   - Create a directory called `cpp_programs` to store your C++ program files.

2. `Navigate to the project directory`:
   - Change into the `cpp_programs` directory using the `cd` command.

3. `Create a new C++ program file using `vi``:
   - Open `vi` and create a new file named `hello_world.cpp`.

4. `Write a simple C++ program`:
   - In `vi`, write a basic C++ program 
   that outputs "Hello, World!" to the console.

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   int main() {
       cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```

5. `Save and exit the `vi` editor`:
   - Save the program and exit `vi` using `:wq`.

6. `Compile the C++ program`:
   - Use the `g++` compiler to compile the program 
   into an executable called `hello_world`.

7. `Run the compiled program`:
   - Run the `hello_world` executable and confirm 
   that it prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

8. `Edit the program`:
   - Reopen the file using `vi` and modify the program 
   to ask the user for their name and 
   print a personalized greeting. 
   Save and exit the file again.

9. `Compile and run the modified program`:
   - Recompile the program and run it to test if it asks 
   for the user's name and displays the greeting correctly.

10. `Delete the C++ program file`:
    - Once done, remove the `hello_world.cpp` file 
    using the `rm` command.

11. `Remove the project directory`:
    - Check if the directory is empty and remove it.

`Goal`:  
This task will help you understand 
how to use the `vi` editor 
to write simple C++ programs, edit them, 
compile them using `g++`, and run them. 

Additionally, you'll become familiar with Linux commands 
for file and directory management.
