Beginner Level Problem Statement: 

C++ Program Management in Linux

`Objective`:  
Familiarize yourself with basic Linux commands 
by creating, compiling, and managing 
a simple C++ program within a project directory.

---

`Tasks`:

1. Create a directory called `cpp_project` 
to store your C++ programs.
2. Navigate into the `cpp_project` directory.
3. Create a C++ file named `first_program.cpp` 
in the directory.
4. Write a simple C++ program inside `first_program.cpp` 
that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
5. Compile the C++ program into an executable.
6. Run the compiled executable to check the output.
7. View the contents of `first_program.cpp` 
using a Linux command.
8. Remove the `first_program.cpp` file after testing it.
9. Check if the directory `cpp_project` is empty and 
then remove it if it is.

`Goal`:  
By completing these tasks, 
you will practice using Linux commands related to file and 
    directory management, 
    text editing, 
    compiling, and 
    running C++ programs.
