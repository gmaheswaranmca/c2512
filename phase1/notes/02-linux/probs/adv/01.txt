### Problem Statement: Efficient Linux Usage for Advanced C++ Development

**Objective**:  
Master Linux commands essential for an advanced C++ programmer by solving tasks related to C++ development workflows. Focus on commands for file management, process handling, debugging, version control, and performance optimization in a Linux environment.

#### Tasks:

1. **File and Directory Management**:  
   - Navigate the file system to organize C++ source files and build artifacts.  
     Example:  
     - Create a project directory with `mkdir`.  
     - List files with specific extensions using `ls` and `find`.  
     - Copy and move files between directories with `cp` and `mv`.

2. **Compilation and Build Tools**:  
   - Use `g++` and `make` to compile and link multi-file C++ programs.  
     Example:  
     - Compile a program with `g++ -o output file1.cpp file2.cpp`.  
     - Automate builds using `make` and write a Makefile.

3. **Debugging with `gdb`**:  
   - Debug a C++ program step-by-step using `gdb`.  
     Example:  
     - Set breakpoints and inspect variable values during runtime.

4. **File Content Management**:  
   - Analyze or modify C++ source code using text-processing commands.  
     Example:  
     - Search for function definitions using `grep`.  
     - Count lines of code with `wc`.  
     - Compare versions of files with `diff`.

5. **Version Control with `git`**:  
   - Manage source code versions using `git`.  
     Example:  
     - Initialize a repository (`git init`).  
     - Commit changes (`git add` and `git commit`).  
     - View logs and differences (`git log`, `git diff`).

6. **Process and Performance Monitoring**:  
   - Optimize and monitor C++ applications using process commands.  
     Example:  
     - View resource usage with `top` or `htop`.  
     - Trace system calls with `strace`.  
     - Measure program performance with `time`.

7. **Error and Log Management**:  
   - Redirect output and manage logs during testing.  
     Example:  
     - Save compiler errors to a file using `2>`.  
     - View logs with `tail` and `less`.

8. **Networking and Deployment**:  
   - Test and deploy C++ applications in a networked environment.  
     Example:  
     - Use `scp` or `rsync` to transfer executables.  
     - Check connectivity with `ping` and `curl`.  
     - Deploy programs on remote systems using `ssh`.

9. **Archiving and Backup**:  
   - Archive and compress project files for deployment.  
     Example:  
     - Create a tarball with `tar -cvf`.  
     - Extract files with `tar -xvf`.

10. **Custom Scripts**:  
    - Automate repetitive tasks using `bash` scripts.  
      Example:  
      - Write a script to compile and test multiple C++ files in one command.
