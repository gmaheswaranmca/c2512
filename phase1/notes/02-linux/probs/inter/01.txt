Problem Statement: 

Intermediate Level Linux Usage for C++ Development

`Objective`:  
Learn and apply essential Linux commands 
in the context of C++ programming 
to enhance your development workflow. 

This task will focus on common Linux commands 
for file management, compiling, debugging, and 
process monitoring that are useful 
to intermediate-level C++ programmers.

Tasks:

1. `File and Directory Management`:  
   - Organize your C++ project files efficiently using basic Linux commands.  
     Example:  
     - Create directories for source files, headers, and executables using `mkdir`.  
     - List files with specific extensions (`.cpp`, `.h`) using `ls` or `find`.  
     - Copy or move C++ files between directories with `cp` and `mv`.

2. `Compiling C++ Programs`:  
   - Compile simple C++ programs and handle errors using the terminal.  
     Example:  
     - Compile a single C++ file using `g++ -o output file.cpp`.  
     - Clean up object files and executables with `rm`.

3. `Debugging Basics with `gdb``:  
   - Use `gdb` to perform basic debugging on C++ programs.  
     Example:  
     - Set breakpoints to step through the code and inspect variable values.  
     - Run your program with `gdb` and use basic commands 
     like `run`, `break`, and `next`.

4. `Text Search and Editing`:  
   - Use Linux text-processing commands 
   to search and manipulate code.  
     Example:  
     - Search for function definitions using `grep`.  
     - Count the number of lines of code in a file using `wc -l`.  
     - View file content with `cat`, `less`, or `more`.

5. `Version Control with `git``:  
   - Use `git` to manage your C++ project and track changes.  
     Example:  
     - Initialize a git repository (`git init`).  
     - Add files and commit changes (`git add .` and `git commit -m "message"`).  
     - View the status of your project with `git status`.

6. `Basic Process Monitoring`:  
   - Monitor the performance of your C++ application and system resources.  
     Example:  
     - View running processes with `ps` or `top`.  
     - Kill a process using `kill` or `kill -9`.

7. `Redirecting Output`:  
   - Redirect standard output and error messages to files during execution.  
     Example:  
     - Save output to a file using `>`, and error output using `2>`.  
     - Append output to a file with `>>`.

8. `File Compression and Archiving`:  
   - Compress and archive your project files for storage or deployment.  
     Example:  
     - Create a compressed archive of your project files 
     with `tar -czvf project.tar.gz`.  
     - Extract files from an archive using `tar -xzvf`.

9. `Running Scripts`:  
   - Write simple shell scripts to automate repetitive C++ tasks.  
     Example:  
     - Create a script to automate the process of 
     compiling and running C++ programs.

10. `Networking Commands`:  
    - Test network connectivity 
    for remote debugging or deploying C++ programs.  
      Example:  
      - Use `ping` to check the connection to a server.  
      - Use `scp` to securely copy files to a remote system.

`Deliverable`:  
Complete each task by applying the appropriate Linux commands. 
Record your experience with these commands and 
how they help streamline your C++ development process. 

Document any challenges you faced and how you solved them.

This modified version should be more approachable 
for an intermediate C++ programmer 
while still allowing you to practice essential Linux commands 
in a development context.
