``ps``, ``top``, and ``free`` commands in Linux

---

`1. `ps` (Process Status)`

The `ps` command provides a snapshot of the currently running processes.

`Basic Syntax`:
```bash
ps [options]
```

`Common Usage`:
1. `Show processes for the current shell`:
   ```bash
   ps
   ```
   - Lists processes started by the current user in the current terminal.

2. `View all processes`:
   ```bash
   ps -e
   ```
   - Displays every running process.

3. `Detailed process view`:
   ```bash
   ps -ep
   ```
   - Includes user, PID (Process ID), parent process, and other details.

4. `View processes by a user`:
   ```bash
   ps -u username
   ```

5. `Find a specific process`:
   ```bash
   ps -ef | grep process_name
   ```

`2. `top` (Task Manager)`

The `top` command provides a real-time view of system performance, including CPU, memory usage, and running processes.

`Basic Syntax`:
```bash
top
```

`Key Features`:
- Displays CPU and memory usage.
- Sorts processes by resource usage.

`Common Usage`:
1. `Start `top``:
   ```bash
   top
   ```

2. `Interact within `top``:
   - ``q``: Quit.
   - ``k``: Kill a process by entering its PID.
   - ``r``: Renice a process (change priority).
   - ``h``: Show help.

3. `Sort by memory usage`:
   Press `M`.

4. `View processes by a specific user`:
   ```bash
   top -u username
   ```

`3. `free` (Memory Usage)`

The `free` command shows information about memory usage, including free, used, and swap memory.

`Basic Syntax`:
```bash
free [options]
```

`Common Usage`:
1. `Display memory usage in bytes`:
   ```bash
   free
   ```

2. `Show memory usage in human-readable format`:
   ```bash
   free -h
   ```
   - Outputs in KB, MB, or GB.

3. `Show memory details continuously`:
   ```bash
   watch free -h
   ```
   - Updates memory information every 2 seconds.


    To stop the watch free -h command or any watch command, simply press:
    ```bash
    Ctrl + C
    ```
4. `Swap memory usage`:
   - Check the "Swap" row for used and free swap memory.

| Command  | Purpose                               | Key Features                                          |
|----------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `ps`     | List running processes (static view). | Displays detailed info on running processes.         |
| `top`    | Real-time process and resource monitor.| Interactive view of CPU, memory, and process usage.  |
| `free`   | Show memory and swap usage.           | Memory usage statistics in different formats.        |

These commands are essential 
for system monitoring and debugging in Linux. 
Use them to manage processes and monitor 
resource usage effectively.
