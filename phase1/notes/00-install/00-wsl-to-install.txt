If you encounter the error 
`sudo: command not found` in WSL, 
it usually means 
that your Linux distribution in WSL 
is not properly set up or is missing critical packages. 
Here's how you can resolve this:

---

Step 1: Check Your WSL Distribution
Run the following command to verify which Linux distribution is installed:
```bash
wsl -l -v
```

If no distribution is listed, or if it's showing as "Installing" or "Uninitialized," you need to install or initialize your WSL distribution.

Step 2: Reinstall or Install a Distribution
If you don't have a proper Linux distribution installed, you can download one:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install -d Ubuntu
   ```
   This installs Ubuntu, which comes with `sudo` pre-installed.

2. If you want a different distribution, list available distributions:
   ```powershell
   wsl --list --online
   ```
   Then install your preferred one:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install -d <distribution_name>
   ```

3. After installation, open the newly installed distribution and set up a username and password. This ensures `sudo` will work.

Step 3: Fix Missing `sudo` in an Existing WSL Installation
If `sudo` is missing in your current WSL installation:

1. Open the WSL terminal.
2. Update the package list using the root user:
   ```bash
   apt update
   ```
3. Install `sudo`:
   ```bash
   apt install sudo
   ```
4. Add your user to the `sudo` group:
   ```bash
   usermod -aG sudo <your_username>
   ```
   Replace `<your_username>` with your actual username.

5. Restart the WSL terminal to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

---

Step 4: Reset Your WSL Distribution (Optional)
If fixing the issue is too complicated or your WSL installation seems corrupted, reset it:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Reset the specific distribution:
   ```powershell
   wsl --unregister <distribution_name>
   ```
3. Reinstall the distribution using:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install -d Ubuntu
   ```

---

Step 5: Use a Temporary Alternative
If `sudo` is not available and you need root privileges temporarily, you can run commands as the root user:

1. Switch to the root user:
   ```bash
   su
   ```
2. Enter the root password (if prompted, or leave blank if none is set).
3. Install `sudo` and other packages as needed.

---

Conclusion
Following these steps will restore or properly install `sudo` 
in your WSL environment. 
Once set up, 
you can proceed with installing other software like `g++`.
