`Machine Language` is 
    the most fundamental level of programming language, 
    consisting solely of 
        binary code—strings of 0s and 1s—
        that is directly understood by a computer's CPU. 

Key Characteristics of Machine Language:
1. `Binary Format`: 
    Instructions are written in binary (such as `10101010`), 
    which corresponds to specific operations 
    in the hardware's instruction set.
2. `Machine-Dependent`: 
    Machine language is unique to each type of computer architecture, 
    meaning that code written 
    for one type of CPU generally won’t work on another.
3. `No Abstractions`: 
    Unlike higher-level languages, 
    machine language provides no abstractions for developers, 
    which makes it challenging and complex to use.
4. `High Performance`: 
    Since instructions are executed directly 
    by the CPU without translation, 
    programs in machine language have fast execution times, 
    ideal for time-critical applications.

Example of Machine Language:
An example of machine language 
might look like `0000 0101 1111 0001`. 
Each segment corresponds to an operation or 
a specific instruction 
(e.g., "add two numbers," 
"move data to a register," etc.), 
determined by the architecture’s instruction set.

Advantages:
- `Efficiency`: 
Code executes very quickly 
as it's directly processed by the CPU.
- `Direct Hardware Control`:
Machine language allows complete control over hardware, 
which is useful for systems programming or tasks 
that require hardware manipulation.

Disadvantages:
- `Complexity`: 
Writing and understanding binary code is error-prone and 
requires thorough knowledge of the CPU architecture.
- `Lack of Portability`: 
Code written for one type of hardware typically won’t run 
on another without significant modification.

Machine language forms the foundation of software 
but is rarely used by modern programmers. 
Instead, higher-level languages 
that are easier to read and write 
are typically compiled or interpreted 
into machine language before execution.
