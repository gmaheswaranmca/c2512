The `Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)` 
consists of several phases 
that ensure the systematic development and 
maintenance of software applications. 

Below are the common phases:

---

1. `Planning`
   - `Purpose`: Define project goals and determine the feasibility of the project.
   - `Key Activities`:
     - Requirement analysis.
     - Feasibility study (technical, financial, and operational).
     - Resource allocation and timeline estimation.
   - `Output`: Project plan, budget, and timeline.

---

2. `Requirement Analysis`
   - `Purpose`: Gather and document detailed business and functional requirements.
   - `Key Activities`:
     - Stakeholder interviews and workshops.
     - Create requirement specifications (Functional Requirement Document - FRD).
     - Define system constraints and expectations.
   - `Output`: Requirement Specification Document (RSD) or Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

---

3. `Design`
   - `Purpose`: Create the architecture and design for the software system.
   - `Key Activities`:
     - High-Level Design (HLD): Architecture, modules, and data flow.
     - Low-Level Design (LLD): Detailed design of individual components.
   - `Output`: Design documents, wireframes, or prototypes.

---

4. `Implementation (Coding)`
   - `Purpose`: Write code based on the design documents.
   - `Key Activities`:
     - Development of modules or components.
     - Code review and version control.
     - Adherence to coding standards.
   - `Output`: Executable software (builds or versions).

---

5. `Testing`
   - `Purpose`: Verify that the software meets requirements and is free of defects.
   - `Key Activities`:
     - Unit Testing: Test individual components.
     - Integration Testing: Test interactions between components.
     - System Testing: Test the complete system.
     - User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Ensure the system meets end-user needs.
   - `Output`: Test cases, test results, and a defect-free product.

---

6. `Deployment`
   - `Purpose`: Deliver the software to the production environment for use.
   - `Key Activities`:
     - Deploy the software in staging and production environments.
     - Conduct final checks and live testing.
     - Provide user training and documentation.
   - `Output`: Live operational software.

---

7. `Maintenance`
   - `Purpose`: Ensure the software operates efficiently post-deployment.
   - `Key Activities`:
     - Bug fixing and patch releases.
     - Performance enhancements.
     - Feature updates based on feedback.
   - `Output`: Updated and reliable software.

Additional SDLC Models
SDLC can follow different models depending on the project:
- `Waterfall Model`: Sequential phases.
- `Agile Model`: Iterative and incremental.
- `Spiral Model`: Risk-driven with iterative cycles.
- `V-Model`: Validation and verification-focused.
- `DevOps`: Continuous integration and delivery.

Each phase has specific deliverables and objectives 
to ensure software quality and project success.
