`Code Sharing and Version Control Tools: GitLab and GitHub`

GitLab and GitHub are popular platforms 
used by developers and teams 
to manage, share, and version control their codebases. 

They are built around `Git`, 
a distributed version control system, 
but they offer additional collaboration features 
for modern software development.

---

`1. Git Overview`
Git is a distributed version control system that:
- Tracks changes to files in a project over time.
- Allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.
- Supports branching and merging to manage different versions of a project.

`4. Key Features of GitLab`
`a. Complete DevOps Platform`
- Combines `code hosting`, `CI/CD`, `security`, and `project management` 
in one tool.

`b. Built-in CI/CD`
- Automate building, testing, and deployment workflows 
using `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration.
- Example: Deploy a Kubernetes-based app directly from GitLab.

`c. Project Management`
- Kanban boards, milestones, and issue tracking for Agile workflows.

`d. Security Features`
- `Code scanning` and `vulnerability management`.
- Provides better compliance tools for enterprises.

`e. Self-Hosting Option`

`6. Why Use GitLab or GitHub?`
`GitHub`
- Best for `open-source projects` and community-driven development.
- Simplifies collaboration with external contributors.

`GitLab`
- Best for `end-to-end DevOps pipelines`.
- Suitable for organizations seeking a self-hosted or 
comprehensive development platform.
