There isn't a universally recognized 
"Software Coding Life Cycle" (SCLC) as
 a standalone framework like SDLC or STLC. 
 However, `coding activities` are 
 a critical part of the broader 
 `Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)` and 
 are often treated as a distinct phase within it.

`Coding Phase in SDLC`

In SDLC, the `Coding or Implementation Phase` is 
where developers translate the design into actual code. 

While thereâ€™s no specific "Software Coding Life Cycle," 
the `coding phase` can be broken into structured activities, 
resembling a lifecycle approach.

`Phases in a Software Coding Process`

1. `Requirement Understanding`
   - `Objective`: Gain a clear understanding of functional and technical requirements.
   - `Activities`:
     - Review the `Software Requirements Specification (SRS)`.
     - Understand the design documents (HLD, LLD).
     - Clarify doubts with stakeholders or designers.
   - `Output`: Developer notes and a coding plan.

2. `Environment Setup`
   - `Objective`: Prepare the tools and technologies needed for development.
   - `Activities`:
     - Set up Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
     - Install required libraries, frameworks, and dependencies.
     - Configure version control systems (e.g., Git).
   - `Output`: Fully functional development environment.

3. `Coding and Implementation`
   - `Objective`: Write code for the software application.
   - `Activities`:
     - Follow coding standards and guidelines.
     - Write modular, reusable, and well-documented code.
     - Implement unit tests to verify individual components.
   - `Output`: Functional source code.

4. `Code Review and Optimization`
   - `Objective`: Ensure the code is efficient, readable, and free of defects.
   - `Activities`:
     - Peer or automated code reviews.
     - Identify and fix issues (bugs, logic errors, security vulnerabilities).
     - Optimize code for performance and scalability.
   - `Output`: Reviewed and optimized code.

5. `Testing and Debugging`
   - `Objective`: Verify that the written code meets the requirements.
   - `Activities`:
     - Test the code using automated or manual methods.
     - Debug and resolve identified issues.
     - Perform regression tests after fixes.
   - `Output`: Debugged and validated code.

6. `Integration`
   - `Objective`: Combine individual modules into a working system.
   - `Activities`:
     - Merge code into a shared repository.
     - Test module interactions.
     - Resolve integration conflicts or errors.
   - `Output`: Integrated software ready for system testing.

7. `Documentation`
   - `Objective`: Create detailed technical and user documentation.
   - `Activities`:
     - Document APIs, functions, and configurations.
     - Write developer guides and end-user manuals.
   - `Output`: Comprehensive code documentation.

8. `Maintenance and Refactoring`
   - `Objective`: Ensure the code remains functional and up-to-date.
   - `Activities`:
     - Fix issues reported post-deployment.
     - Refactor code to adapt to new requirements or improve performance.
   - `Output`: Updated and maintainable code.

`Key Principles in Coding`
- `Modularity`: Write code in smaller, reusable modules.
- `Consistency`: Follow coding standards and naming conventions.
- `Documentation`: Write comments and documentation for better understanding.
- `Testing`: Include automated and manual testing during coding.

`Conclusion`
While "Software Coding Life Cycle" (SCLC) isn't an established term, 
the coding process within SDLC follows a structured approach. 

It emphasizes understanding requirements, 
writing efficient code, and ensuring quality through reviews and testing. 

This process plays a crucial role in delivering high-quality software.
