The `Waterfall Model` is a `sequential and linear approach` 
to software development. 

It is one of the earliest SDLC models, 
emphasizing completing each phase before moving to the next. 

This model works well for projects 
with clearly defined requirements and 
minimal expected changes during development.

`Phases of the Waterfall Model`

1. `Requirement Analysis`
   - `Objective`: Collect and document all the software requirements.
   - `Activities`:
     - Stakeholder discussions to identify needs.
     - Create a detailed `Software Requirement Specification (SRS)` document.
   - `Output`: Clear, documented requirements.

---

2. `System Design`
   - `Objective`: Develop the architecture and design of the system.
   - `Activities`:
     - High-Level Design (HLD): Overall system structure, database design, and data flow.
     - Low-Level Design (LLD): Detailed design of each module or component.
   - `Output`: Design documents, diagrams, and specifications.

---

3. `Implementation (Coding)`
   - `Objective`: Translate the design into actual code.
   - `Activities`:
     - Developers write and integrate code for all modules.
     - Use programming tools and follow coding standards.
   - `Output`: Source code and executable builds.

---

4. `Testing`
   - `Objective`: Identify and fix defects in the system.
   - `Activities`:
     - Unit Testing: Verify individual components.
     - Integration Testing: Test interactions between modules.
     - System Testing: Check overall system functionality.
     - Acceptance Testing: Validate the software against the requirements.
   - `Output`: Tested and defect-free product.

---

5. `Deployment`
   - `Objective`: Deliver the software to the customer for use.
   - `Activities`:
     - Deploy the product to the production environment.
     - Provide training and documentation for users.
   - `Output`: Fully deployed system.

---

6. `Maintenance`
   - `Objective`: Address issues and improve functionality post-deployment.
   - `Activities`:
     - Bug fixing, updates, and enhancements.
     - Performance optimization and support.
   - `Output`: Updated and reliable software.

---

`Key Characteristics`
- `Sequential Process`: Each phase must be completed before the next begins.
- `Documentation-Driven`: Heavily relies on detailed documentation at each phase.
- `No Overlap`: Thereâ€™s no returning to previous phases after completion 
    (except through costly revisions).

---

`Advantages`
- `Simple and Easy to Understand`: 
    Clear structure makes it ideal for beginners.
- `Well-Suited for Stable Requirements`: 
    Works best when requirements are clear and unchanging.
- `Well-Defined Phases`: 
    Each phase has specific deliverables and objectives.
- `Documentation`: 
    Comprehensive documentation ensures clarity and reduces ambiguity.

---

`Disadvantages`
- `Inflexibility`: 
    Changes in requirements late in the process 
    can be expensive or unfeasible.
- `Delayed Testing`: 
    Errors are found only in the testing phase, 
    potentially leading to rework.
- `Unsuitable for Complex Projects`: 
    Does not accommodate iterative development or 
    frequent changes.

---

`When to Use the Waterfall Model`
- Projects with clearly defined and unchanging requirements.
- Small-scale projects with straightforward goals.
- When detailed documentation is critical (e.g., regulatory or compliance-heavy projects).

The Waterfall Model is suitable for projects where precision and predictability outweigh the need for adaptability. However, for modern software development, iterative models like `Agile` are often preferred.
