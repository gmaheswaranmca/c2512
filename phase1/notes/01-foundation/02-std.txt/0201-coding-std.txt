C++ coding standards help developers write code 
that is consistent, readable, and maintainable. 
Here are some widely accepted C++ coding standards:

`1. `Naming Conventions`
   - `Variables`: Use `camelCase` or `snake_case` for variable names (e.g., `myVariable` or `my_variable`). Avoid abbreviations, especially for public members.
   - `Constants`: Use `ALL_CAPS` for constants (e.g., `MAX_SIZE`).
   - `Functions`: Use `camelCase` for function names (e.g., `computeArea()`).
   - `Classes and Structs`: Use `PascalCase` (e.g., `MyClass`).
   - `Namespaces`: Use `lowercase` for namespaces (e.g., `namespace myproject`).
   - `Member Variables`: Use a prefix like `m_` or `_` (e.g., `m_value` or `_value`) for private member variables.

`2. `Code Organization`
   - `Header Guards`: Use `#pragma once` or include guards in header files:
     ```cpp
     #ifndef MY_HEADER_H
     #define MY_HEADER_H
     // Header code
     #endif // MY_HEADER_H
     ```
   - `Class Declarations in Headers`: Define classes in header files (`.h` or `.hpp`) and implement them in source files (`.cpp`).
   - `Function Declarations`: Keep function declarations in headers and definitions in source files, unless the function is a short inline function.
   - `Namespace Usage`: Avoid using `using namespace std;` in headers, as it can pollute the global namespace.

`3. `Formatting`
   - `Indentation`: Use consistent indentation (usually 2 or 4 spaces). Avoid tabs, as they can vary in appearance across different editors.
   - `Braces`: Use the "Allman" style or "K&R" style consistently.
     ```cpp
     // Allman style
     if (condition)
     {
         // code
     }
     ```
     ```cpp
     // K&R style
     if (condition) {
         // code
     }
     ```
   - `Line Length`: Keep lines shorter than 80-100 characters where possible.
   - `Whitespace`: Use whitespace to improve readability around operators, after commas, and around control flow keywords.

`4. `Commenting and Documentation`
   - `Document Functions`: Use comments to describe the purpose of functions, parameters, return values, and potential exceptions.
     ```cpp
     /`
      * Computes the area of a rectangle.
      * @param width - width of the rectangle.
      * @param height - height of the rectangle.
      * @return area of the rectangle.
      */
     double computeArea(double width, double height);
     ```
   - `In-line Comments`: Use in-line comments sparingly, focusing on complex logic or assumptions.

`5. `Error Handling`
   - `Prefer Exceptions Over Error Codes`: Use exceptions to handle errors in C++ where appropriate. Define custom exception classes for specific error types if needed.
   - `Use `try`/`catch` Blocks`: Handle exceptions gracefully and avoid unnecessary `catch(...)` blocks that catch all exceptions.
   - `Avoid `goto` Statements`: Avoid using `goto`, as it makes the code flow harder to follow.

`6. `Memory Management`
   - `Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)`: Manage resources with objects that automatically clean up in their destructors.
   - `Use Smart Pointers`: Use `std::unique_ptr` for exclusive ownership and `std::shared_ptr` for shared ownership to avoid manual memory management with `new` and `delete`.
   - `Avoid Raw Pointers When Possible`: Prefer `std::vector`, `std::string`, and other standard containers over raw arrays and `char*`.

`7. `Use of `const``
   - `Immutable Data`: Use `const` for immutable data, both for variables and function parameters.
   - `Const Member Functions`: Mark member functions as `const` if they don’t modify the object state.
     ```cpp
     class MyClass {
     public:
         int getValue() const { return value; }
     private:
         int value;
     };
     ```

`8. `Efficient Use of Standard Libraries`
   - `Avoid `std::endl``: Prefer `\n` over `std::endl` for performance, as `std::endl` also flushes the buffer.
   - `Use STL Algorithms and Containers`: Prefer the Standard Template Library (STL) containers (e.g., `std::vector`, `std::map`) and algorithms (e.g., `std::sort`, `std::find`) for safe and optimized data handling.

`9. `Best Practices for Classes and Functions`
   - `Limit Class Responsibility`: Follow the Single Responsibility Principle by designing classes that have one clear purpose.
   - `Avoid Large Functions`: Split large functions into smaller, manageable functions. A function should ideally do one thing only.
   - `Prefer `explicit` Keyword`: Use `explicit` for single-argument constructors to prevent unintended implicit conversions.
   - `Prefer Initialization Lists`: Use member initialization lists in constructors to initialize members instead of assignment in the constructor body.
   - `Delete Unused Functions`: Use `= delete` to explicitly delete functions you don’t want to allow (like copy constructors or assignment operators).
     ```cpp
     MyClass(const MyClass&) = delete;
     MyClass& operator=(const MyClass&) = delete;
     ```

`10. `Testing and Validation`
   - `Unit Testing`: Use unit testing frameworks (like Google Test) to write tests for individual classes and functions.
   - `Assertions`: Use `assert` for conditions that must always be true in debug mode to catch programming errors.
   - `Continuous Integration`: Integrate tests into a CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early and ensure code quality.

Following these standards will result in clean, maintainable, and reliable C++ code.
