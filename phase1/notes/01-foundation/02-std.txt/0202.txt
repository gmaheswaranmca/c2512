For intermediate developers, 
C++ coding standards focus on both 
writing clean, 
maintainable code and 
utilizing more advanced language features and 
best practices. 

Here’s a set of standards to guide you:

---

1. `Naming Conventions and Code Structure`

   - `Consistent Naming`: Stick to naming conventions across the project to ensure consistency:
     - Variables and function parameters: `camelCase`
     - Constants and macros: `ALL_CAPS`
     - Class names and enums: `PascalCase`
     - Private member variables: Prefix with `m_` (e.g., `m_value`).

   - `Organize Code into Layers`:
     - Use headers for interface declarations (`.h` or `.hpp`) and source files (`.cpp`) for implementation.
     - Group related classes and functions within namespaces for organization and avoid name collisions.

   - `Limit File Length`: Keep files manageable (ideally under 500 lines). For large classes or files, split them into smaller files logically.

2. `Advanced Memory Management`

   - `Smart Pointers over Raw Pointers`:
     - Use `std::unique_ptr` for exclusive ownership, `std::shared_ptr` for shared ownership, and `std::weak_ptr` to avoid circular references.
     - Avoid manual `new` and `delete` where possible. Smart pointers automatically handle memory deallocation.

   - `Avoid Memory Leaks`:
     - Avoid raw pointers as members; prefer smart pointers or automatic (stack) variables.
     - Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) for resource management; encapsulate resources in objects that automatically clean up in their destructors.

   - `Avoid `new` in Constructors`: Instead, initialize resources using member initialization lists or factory methods for better readability and error handling.

3. `Effective Use of `const` and `constexpr``

   - `Use `const` Correctly`:
     - Apply `const` to function parameters and member functions that do not modify the object state.
     - Use `const` with pointers and iterators to clarify intent.

   - `Use `constexpr` for Compile-Time Constants`:
     - Prefer `constexpr` over `const` for constants that can be computed at compile-time.
     - This improves performance and helps the compiler optimize code further.

4. `Error Handling and Exception Safety`

   - `Exception-Safe Code`:
     - Use RAII to handle resources in a way that automatically cleans up, even in the presence of exceptions.
     - Avoid using exceptions for regular control flow; use them for exceptional situations only.

   - `Error Handling`:
     - Validate inputs at the beginning of functions and return immediately if invalid, following a “guard clause” approach.
     - Document exceptions thrown by functions to clarify which exceptions may be raised.

5. `Efficient Use of Standard Library and STL Containers`

   - `Use STL Containers Appropriately`:
     - Prefer `std::vector`, `std::string`, and other STL containers over raw arrays.
     - For associative containers, use `std::unordered_map` when ordering is unnecessary for better performance.
     - Choose the right container for the job (e.g., `std::deque` for fast front/back insertions, `std::set` for unique ordered elements).

   - `Use STL Algorithms`:
     - Use algorithms like `std::find`, `std::sort`, and `std::accumulate` instead of hand-coding loops.
     - Algorithms often improve readability and may have optimizations that hand-coded solutions lack.

6. `Write Readable and Maintainable Code`

   - `Self-Documenting Code`: Write code that explains itself as much as possible:
     - Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
     - Avoid “magic numbers” (use named constants instead).

   - `Comment Only When Necessary`:  
     - Add comments for complex logic, edge cases, or intent, but avoid redundant comments.
     - Use `TODO` and `FIXME` comments to mark areas for improvement.

   - `Use Function Overloading and Default Parameters`:
     - Leverage C++’s function overloading for multiple versions of a function.
     - Use default parameters for optional arguments instead of overloaded methods.

7. `Optimize with Modern C++ Features`

   - `Move Semantics`:
     - Use `std::move` to indicate ownership transfer in functions to avoid unnecessary copies.
     - Implement move constructors and move assignment operators in classes where performance matters.

   - `Range-Based Loops`:
     - Use range-based `for` loops where possible for readability and performance.
       ```cpp
       for (const auto& item : container) {
           // Work with item
       }
       ```

   - `Auto for Type Inference`:
     - Use `auto` when the type is obvious or unimportant, but avoid overusing it as it can reduce code readability.

8. `Design Patterns and Best Practices`

   - `Use Design Patterns Judiciously`:
     - For intermediate developers, consider using patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer when they simplify the design.

   - `Avoid Over-Engineering`:
     - Follow the YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It) principle. Implement functionality when it’s necessary, not before.
   
   - `Encapsulate Code in Functions`:
     - Avoid writing large functions; split them into smaller, single-purpose functions.

9. `Testing and Validation`

   - `Unit Testing`:
     - Write unit tests for critical functionality, particularly for complex algorithms or classes with dependencies.
     - Consider using testing frameworks like Google Test or Catch2 to ensure reliability.

   - `Assertions`:
     - Use `assert` in debug mode to verify assumptions. Avoid `assert` in production code unless it’s safe and required.

10. `Performance Optimization and Profiling`

   - `Profile Before Optimizing`:
     - Use profiling tools to find bottlenecks before making optimizations.
     - Focus on optimizing critical paths rather than premature optimization.

   - `Avoid Unnecessary Copies`:
     - Use references (`const &`) and `std::move` to avoid unnecessary copying of large data structures.

   - `Minimize Expensive Operations`:
     - Avoid frequent memory allocation/deallocation in performance-critical code.
     - Use `reserve` for `std::vector` if the size is known in advance.

11. `Concurrency and Thread Safety`

   - `Use Modern C++ Concurrency`:
     - Use C++11’s `<thread>`, `<mutex>`, `<condition_variable>`, and other concurrency primitives for multi-threaded code.
     - Avoid raw threads unless necessary; consider higher-level abstractions like thread pools.

   - `Thread-Safe Data Structures`:
     - Use atomic operations or thread-safe data structures where possible.
     - Lock only as long as necessary to avoid deadlocks and contention.

Example Code Following These Standards

Here’s a sample class that follows the coding standards above:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <memory>

class Employee {
public:
    Employee(std::string name, int id)
        : m_name(std::move(name)), m_id(id) {}

    [[nodiscard]] int getId() const noexcept { return m_id; }
    [[nodiscard]] const std::string& getName() const noexcept { return m_name; }

    static std::unique_ptr<Employee> createEmployee(std::string name, int id) {
        return std::make_unique<Employee>(std::move(name), id);
    }

private:
    std::string m_name;
    int m_id;
};

int main() {
    auto employee = Employee::createEmployee("Alice", 1);
    std::cout << "Employee Name: " << employee->getName() << "\n";
    std::cout << "Employee ID: " << employee->getId() << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates best practices like `const` correctness, `unique_ptr` for dynamic memory, `std::move` for efficient data handling, and encapsulation of resource management within the class itself.
